# Frontend Love Eindhoven 2019

On the 22nd of November, 8 of us went on a small roadtrip to Eindhoven to visit the inaugural Frontend Love Eindhoven edition.
With a total of 8 talks scheduled in the afternoon, it promised to be a very busy time.
The subjects of the talks were quite diverse: ranging from tips to improve your frontend components to sharing experiences with managing an open-source project.
In this blogpost we'll share some key things we've learned from these talks.
