# Introduction

Attending conferences in these times tends to be a pretty new experience, with everything being virtual.

The Kafka Summit 2020 in London was cancelled, but the one in Austin was not.
However, it was transformed.
Transformed in a new format, completely COVID proof, fully remote and virtual.

I love conferences, as these bring me knew knowledge and insights.

But, my experience with virtual ones is quite limited.

Please note, working remote is no issue, as I have become a true senior remote developer in the last 6 months.


# Day 2

## Where is Day 1?
Timezone difference combined with a busy day at work is not that ideal.

<<understatement>>
    
Since the coffee was no longer helping I decided to dive in the bed in order to charge up the batteries for the next day.

## Keynote The Tyrrany of Data by Sam Newman

## Future of Kafka

## Paypall session - TODO find the title

## Kafka Kubernetes

## Experienced Developers
This session was one of those discussion ones and it was full.

I am not sure what the limit is of these rooms, but that is kinda annoying.
It would be nice if they could show a counter on the schedule about how full that session is, it is all virtual so that should be possible

## Devops on Kafka

## Maximize Business Value of Machine Learning and Data Science with Kafka

## Some other stuff I noticed
(No pauses between sessions - not nice ...)
(The sessions last 1 hour, but sessions start every 30 minutes - 2 blocks to sessions â€¦ can be annoying when you want to follow overlapping sessions, but does give you more options to switch when there are no / less interesting sessions in 1 block)
(There was a link to speak with a tech to address tech issues)

Badges for attentind sponsor booths
But they were quite sparse - somewhat understandable because it is all pretty short notice.
But I didn't really feel like chatting directly with one of the persons, because I was just looking around, but this is something which might be an interesting avenu to explore.
Have companies be able to use their own virtual booth, which they can 'bring along' to every virtual conference, but that is going to be pretty hard to setup.

There were not that much discussions
