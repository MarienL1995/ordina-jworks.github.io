# Intro

Everyone who writes software (for a living) has implemented a way to identify and authenticate users. Either in the application itself or via an Identity management platform or IDP for short. 

Today, you can find several platforms that handles user login requests. Like Keycloak, OKTA, OpenAM , ... etc. All those platforms have their own features and posibilities that may be useful for your usecase. 

In this blogpost, we'll focus on Keycloak. An open-source identity management platform from Jboss (Red Hat). We have chosen for Keycloak because of it's well-compreshensive documentation and a lot of connectors to choose form.
