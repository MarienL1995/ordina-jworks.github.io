# Devoxx Ukraine 2018
> 2018 saw the very first edition of Devoxx Ukraine. 
Previously known as Javaday Kiev, the organisers teamed up with Devoxx to reach a broader audience.
This was apparently a successful move as they conference grew 30% and had 3 times as many proposals sent in.
We attended with 5 people and even spoke ourselves on a variety of topics.

## Day 1: Friday November 23rd
### Troubleshooting & Debugging Production Microservices in Kubernetes - Ray Tsang and Baruch Sadogursky
