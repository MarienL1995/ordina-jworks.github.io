# Devoxx Ukraine 2018
> 2018 saw the very first edition of Devoxx Ukraine. 
Previously known as Javaday Kiev, the organisers teamed up with Devoxx to reach a broader audience.
This was apparently a successful move as they conference grew 30% and had 3 times as many proposals sent in.
We attended with 5 people and even spoke ourselves on a variety of topics.

## Day 1: Friday November 23rd
### Troubleshooting & Debugging Production Microservices in Kubernetes - Ray Tsang and Baruch Sadogursky

## Day 2: Saturday November 24rd

### Neo4J - Michael Simmons

JQAssistent: scan a program to see defects.

Graph DB logical model of the db is like the whiteboard model => the business can understand.

OpenCypher, GQL Manifesto - also supported by Redis

The with clause, like a pipe, in cypther is very powerfull.

Neo4J ETL Tool can be pointed to a relational db and is able to retrieve some structure.
You can build your own db importer in java.

APOC, Awesome Procedures on Cypher => TODO: google this, lots of stuff, check it out

From the JVM binary bolt protocol, by google.

Neo4J OGM based on principles of hibernate.
Java 11 is supported.

Spring Data Neo4J, supported by Neo4j, cypher can be used.

Neo4JRepository supports @Depth
It is recommended to only extends from this repository when its specific functionality is needed, otherwhise you will leak too much 
@Queryresult
Derived finder methods (findByName)

Spring Boot Starter Neo4J
Also with @DataNeo4JTest

Spring Data Neo4J Don't: 
* not for batch processing
* don't abuse derived method names, too long ones
* don't follow graph model blindly while modelling domain, a graph model answers a specific question.

Id field is needed into the entity object, so OGM can map it properly

More Cypher
Netflix uses something like micro-categories, not like 1 category but multiple attributes.

Demo personal db
relatively new in Neo4J is support for spatial data
ticketmaster API is good to grap venue data.

Some use cases
* Panama Papers
* Diabetic research center

Get Started
neo4j.com/download
neo4j.com/graphgists (example use cases and stuff)

TODO: add links to the resource page

Good tool to test DB's is a test container, a docker image with a DB running into it.


### Twitter Graal VM - Chris

'#twitterVMTEAM' => doubled in size to 8 people.

JEP 243 was needed to enable GraalVM

talk about Graal JIT compiler

(TODO: get the twitter image of the microservices, from 2016)
=> too much to handtune your services.
Also deploys occur daily, optimizations of today might be useless tomorrow.

The goal is to replace the performance engineer by a black box, the ML black box will tell us where to look next.
Use Bagesian optimization
TODO: youtube reference to some links - was 10 min in Chris' talk

Bagesian optimization originated for gold mining

TODO: Add link to graalVM on youtube, 17 min in talk.
jvnci-0.30 => TODO check

They focus on reducing GC's and on user CPU time, which has an impact on the instance size.
=> Largest cost savings are to be found here.
Latency tuning

GraalVM allows twitter to leverage the compiler more.
