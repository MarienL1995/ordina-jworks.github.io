# Introduction

KubeCon | CloudNativeCon is a conference organised by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation twice a year, alternating between Europe and US locations. 
This edition was done in Valencia in Spain. 
The conference is the industry conference for anything Kubernetes / container related technology. 
Talks range from end-user stories of the usage of Kubernetes, over methods to automate compliancy in Cloud to technical deep dives into specific cloud native building blocks.
Next to the talks, there's a solution exhibition as well.
This is where vendors and (CNCF) projects have booths and you can talk to core contributors of most of the projects.

# Key takeaways

## OpenTelemetry

OpenTelemetry is an CNCF project focussed on capturing different telemetry signals from applications.
It's a collections of tools, SDKs and APIs that enable effective observability. 

In esssence, it's an ecosystem of tools that can instrument, capture and ship (currently) telemetry data to differnt systems. 
The idea is that the tooling to do so is provided by OpenTelemetry and the analysis, usage and storage is performed by other third party tools like Dynatrace, AWS X-Ray, Elastic, Grafana LGTM and any other toolstack supporting telemetry data.
