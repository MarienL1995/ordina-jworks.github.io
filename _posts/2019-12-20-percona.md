# Percona Open Source Database Conference 2019 


> Percona, a leading provider of unbiased open source database solutions, organized its yearly Open Source Database Conference in Amsterdam from September 30th till October the 2nd. This conference is an excellent opportunity to discover and discuss the latest open source trends, technologies and innovations, and off course Percona's own solutions. After Amsterdam in 2016 and Dublin in 2017, it was the third time Ordina Jworks signed up for this conference making it gradually becoming a tradition.

## Introduction

There are not many database related blog posts to be found on the JWorks blog.  Are databases boring? Databases may seem boring, but they are inevitable. There’s no way to avoid databases themselves.  Many developers just see it as a place to store your data.  People rarely imagine that database management could be exciting. However, once you’re getting under the hood, you will realize how interesting a lot of database problems are.  A DBA can draw a lot of pride when he or she turns a 100 millisecond query into a 2 millisecond query. My opinion? Databases do not always get the attention they deserve. 

The  Percona Open Source Database conference shows that there are a lot of interesting things to say about databases whether they are relational or NOSQL.  If you are a commercial database believer then you can’t do much here.  As the name suggests, the whole conference is about open source databases. 

As in previous editions of the Conference the concept remains unchanged.  The conference starts with a 'Tutorials Day' on the first day followed by 2 days of actual conference. Percona is the organizer of the conference so their tools and services will be discussed in detail, but with about 90 talks about everything that has to do with relational and non-relational open source databases, everyone will get their money's worth. It only makes it more difficult to choose which sessions to attend. 



## Keynotes

Each self-respecting conference starts with one or more keynotes which was also the case here.

## PostgreSQL

Because of my Oracle background I have more affinity with relational DBMS than with let's say next generation databases. And although the focus of the conference is on MariaDB & MySQL, with more than 37 talks on the subject, I preferred following the sessions about PostgreSQL. Why? Well PostgreSQL has become increasingly popular in recent years. PostgreSQL is the rising star and for many developers it is the coolest database out there. According to DB engines that measures the popularity of databases, PostgreSQL now ranks fourth among the most popular databases, after Oracle, MySQL and Microsoft SQL Server and it was referred to as 'Database of the year' in both 2017 and 2018.

Why do I, as an Oracle DBA, advocate PostgresQL? Because Oracle autonomous databases are taking more and more DBA tasks out of our hands, we as Oracle DBAs are forced to broaden our horizon. 




### Migrating to PostgreSQL

The reasons for migrating from Oracle to PostgreSQL are obvious for many companies. The main driver is of course the cost, but Oracle's licensing model is also often a nightmare. In addition, PostgreSQL has also become a mature database. PostgreSQL commends itself as the World's most advanced open source relational database.  

So when the company's management has decided to migrate to PostgreSQL, is it a difficult task as Oracle DBA to make the switch? Not really. Because the fundamentals and features remain largely the same, the learning curve is not steep at all.

The pitfalls you often encounter as an administrator were discussed in the session ***"Top 10 Mistakes When Migrating From Oracle to PostgreSQL"***
